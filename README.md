Phase 1-First Project: Drinking In The Moment

Project Concept:

A place where a user ( mainly people bartending from home) can access information on different types of drinks. A user has been making the same drink wanting to try something new. They can access a random drink if they are unsure of what to make or look up a beverage they are interested in making.

I brought this project to life using Visual Studio Code and Ubuntu 20.04


How does it all work: 

When a user first comes to the site, they have two choices: 

a Dealer Choice button; a bring up a random drink with all of the information, for example, the preferred glass, and a list of ingredients that the cocktail will need is rendered. The next button the user can click on is Pick Your Poison; this will create a form where users can input their desired drink or drink details when the user has found the cocktail, to help the user keep track of that cocktail or if they want to remember a specific drink. They can click on add to favorites, and it will be added into a sidebar for easy access while they continue to browse.
